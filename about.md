Great! Now that the formalities are out of the way, let's get into the interesting stuff.

I believe in attention to detail. From two similar applications, I will always choose the better-looking one. I could discuss colour schemes, fonts, and layouts for days.

I want to live in a world where engineers and designers understand each other, with no need for middle-men where jargon gets misinterpreted. With this in mind, I'm working towards a holistic way of service creation by honing my technical skills at Aalto.  I've dabbled with HTML and CSS; Scala, Python, and Java; and created this website with Jekyll. 

I'm interested in story-telling. For peace of mind, I will always turn to my camera; for distraction, I pick up a book; and lately, I've developed a keen interest in video. Good story-telling is captivating, and makes you question whether you live in this reality or that which you have just experienced ('the after-cinema high').

While I'm still very much learning, I'm loving the process and wouldn't object to sharing the experience with You.

I'm currently looking for work in the summer of 2017. Feel free to [download my CV][1], and contact me via email (firstname.secondname at aalto.fi)!
