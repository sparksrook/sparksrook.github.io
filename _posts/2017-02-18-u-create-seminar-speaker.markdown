[The U-Create seminar][ucreate] took place on Nov 1st-2nd, 2016 at the new Aalto University Learning Centre. As part of the program, I attended and spoke at a panel titled "Pizza & a date with University Wide Art Studies", along with UWAS Project Manager Juuso Tervo, Professor Harri Laakso, Vice President of Education Eero Eloranta, and Lecturers Kirsi Peltonen and Andy Best. 

Excerpt from [UWAS' website][uwas]:

>"At Aalto University we believe the future of education exists at the crossroads of science, technology, business and art. University Wide Art Studies (UWAS) offers access to art-based thinking for every discipline in the university through a series of field neutral courses on creativity and culture."

I believe transdisciplinary learning to be a necessity in the near-future world of work, which is why I am passionate about this project. On top of that, I fully stand by [Aalto University's values][values], from which I would especially like to highlight the following: 

* Integrity
* Openness
* Equality
