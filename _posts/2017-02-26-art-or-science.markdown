[ARTS-A0900 Project: Scientific Versus Art Imagery, an Instagram Exploration][1]

I wanted to explore the boundaries between scientific and art imagery; I especially wished to narrow down some of the signifiers that make us think of one or the other when we are exposed to these types of images. My full work process and conclusions can be found by clicking the link above, or [here][1].

Excerpt from "Execution and Analysis":
> My first image is a visualization of worldwide air traffic; more specifically, ”Transformation Clusters” by Martin Grandjean from “Connected World: Untangling the Air Traffic Network”. It carries many visual cues that one might associate with scientific imagery: the circles and lines that form the network are widely used in data visualisation, it is clearly a map of the Earth, a short and concise title including the word ”clusters”, text which indicates geographical properties and source of data, and so forth. Yet, I would claim that it is not just one of these factors alone, but the combination that truly delivers the message to the viewer.
